# COSC-499-Exercise-1
This code outputs differently in each file. In Main.java, "Main branch!" is printed; in BranchA.java, "Branch A!" is printed; and in BranchB.java, "Branch B!" is printed. These three files were created in main branch, Branch A, and Branch B correspondingly, and a TestBranch.java is updated in each branch and tested on these outputs. 

Pull requests are created and reviewed, and finally merged into main branch for different branches.
